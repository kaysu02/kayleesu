                                        Customers during the height of the pandemic wanted to avoid exposure to COVID-19 without giving 
                                        up their shopping experience. They enjoyed forming relationships with ingredients by selecting 
                                        their own produce in-store, so I needed to create a sustainable hybrid shopping experience to 
                                        minimize germ exposure while providing the freedom to manage all necessary in-store transactions 
                                        efficiently and independently through the H-E-B mobile application.

                                    H-E-B shoppers can now more efficiently purchase groceries through an added feature in the MyHEB mobile app. 
                                    They can input produce information (price, weight, quantity) on their phone through scanning appropriate 
                                    barcodes in-store. Meanwhile, the produce will be placed in one reusable bag within their cart, removing the 
                                    need to individually bag or sort products. Afterwards, all of the individual product information will 
                                    accumulate into one “checkout barcode” that is easily scanned during checkout to streamline the purchasing 
                                    process and increase customer independence. Since users will only scan one cumulative barcode to checkout, 
                                    unnecessary wait times in-store will be minimized, allowing for decreased exposure to COVID-19.

                                        I utilized the RITE (Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation) method with 2 unmoderated sessions, 
                                        3 participants each, and the usability testing participants were filtered by these constraints:

                                        The overall goal during testing was to identify the users’ thoughts and understanding of the produce 
                                        scanning feature while gathering customer feedback to iterate and develop on the visual components

                                        I utilized the H-E-B design language system in Figma to create additional components as well as the 
                                        overall design and navigation for the produce scanning feature. The feature utilizes a button on the 
                                        home screen to quickly navigate to the “scanning screen” with a list modal displayed on the bottom 
                                        third of the screen for easy viewing of previously “scanned in” produce. The modal is expandable and 
                                        contains a “checkout barcode” button so users can easily present their final cumulative barcode during
                                         checkout.
